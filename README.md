Shadowdark_level_0.exe is a program (made in python) to generate a 0-level character for Shadowdark. It creates a .txt file and then saves it in the same directory as the program. This program may only run with Windows. Please let me know if you know how to make it compatible with other systems.

Shadowdark_level_0.py is the python file used to create the application.

You are free to use these files however you wish. These files are experimental and neither I nor GitHub is responsible e for any damage their use may cause.

Shadowdark Character Generator
This is a simple RPG character generator written in Python that generates a random character sheet based on randomly selected attributes.

How to use
To use the generator, run the rpg_character_generator.py script. The script will prompt you to enter the character's name and then generate a character sheet based on randomly selected attributes.

The generated character sheet will be saved in a file with the same name as the character's name, in a .txt format.

How it works
The generator works by randomly selecting values for each attribute of the character. The following attributes are randomly generated:

Background: The character's background is randomly selected from a list of backgrounds.

Stats: The character's stats (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma) are generated by rolling three six-sided dice and summing the results. The resulting number is then multiplied by a gold multiplier (either 1 or 5, depending on whether gold or stats are being rolled).

Ancestry: The character's ancestry is randomly selected from a list of ancestries, each of which has a corresponding talent.

HP: The character's HP is calculated based on their Constitution stat, with an additional +2 HP for Dwarves.

Alignment: The character's alignment is randomly selected from a list of alignments.

Gold/Gear: The character's starting gold or gear is generated by rolling three six-sided dice and summing the results. The resulting number is then multiplied by a gold multiplier of 5.

The generator then prompts the user to enter the character's name and saves the generated character sheet to a file with the same name as the character.

File Structure
The generated character sheet is structured as follows:

php
Copy code
Name: <name>
Level: 0
Ancestry: <ancestry>
Alignment: <alignment>
Background: <background>
HP: <hp>, AC:
STR: <str> (<str_mod>)
DEX: <dex> (<dex_mod>)
CON: <con> (<con_mod>)
INT: <int> (<int_mod>)
WIS: <wis> (<wis_mod>)
CHA: <cha> (<cha_mod>)
Ancestry Talent: <talent>
Gold: <gold>
Where <name> is the character's name, <ancestry> is the character's randomly generated ancestry, <alignment> is the character's randomly generated alignment, <background> is the character's randomly generated background, <hp> is the character's HP, <str>, <dex>, <con>, <int>, <wis>, and <cha> are the character's randomly generated stats, <str_mod>, <dex_mod>, <con_mod>, <int_mod>, <wis_mod>, and <cha_mod> are the corresponding stat modifiers, <talent> is the talent corresponding to the character's ancestry, and <gold> is the character's randomly generated gold or gear.

Requirements
This generator uses the built-in random and math modules in Python and does not have any additional dependencies.
